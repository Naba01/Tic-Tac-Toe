# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal 
with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
